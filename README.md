### Today's Agenda
- Setting up User Profile
- Updating the User Profile
- Setting up custom User model
- Setting up forms for User model

### User Profile
User Profiles are common in most web applications. It is a way to store additional information about a user. In this session, we will begin by setting up a user profile for our application.

### Updating User Profile
We will also see how to update the user profile. This is a common feature in most applications where the user can update their profile information. The user profile will be updated using a user form.

### Custom User Model
Django provides a default User model which is sufficient for most applications. However, there are cases where you might need to extend the User model. In this session, we will see how to set up a custom User model. The custom User model will be used to store additional information about the user. This means that custom models are created by extending the default User model.
